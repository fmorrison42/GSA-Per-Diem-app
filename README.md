GSA Per Diem Calculator Application
================

A Per Diem calculator based on travel destination and number of days spent.

This will be viewable on all devices.

One day there will be a calculator, spreadsheet, and database behind it all to keep track of how much is spent each day while on TAD.  

Once the TAD trip is over, the traveler can request the full spreadsheet be published, emailed to them, and printed if desired so they can track how much was spent during their trip.

First Iteration will be online and working by Jan 1, 2015.
